2. **Model Definitions**  
   ```python
   # Example 
   class Task(models.Model):
       COMPLETE = "Complete"
       INCOMPLETE = "Incomplete"
       STATUS_CHOICES = [
           (COMPLETE, "Complete"),
           (INCOMPLETE, "Incomplete")
       ]
       detail = models.CharField(max_length=200)

   ```

3. **Implementation Checklist and detailed code changes**

#### Coding conventions and rules
<ProjectArchitecture>

This outlines the Clean Architecture implementation of the project. It describes the folder structure, responsibilities of each layer, and guidelines for development within this architecture.

</FolderStructure>

<CleanArchitecture>

<LayerExplanation>

<Exceptions>
The exceptions package, specifically the custom_exceptions module, defines all custom exceptions used throughout the app. These custom exceptions help in handling specific error scenarios in a structured manner.
</Exceptions>

<Interactors>
The interactors package implements the core business logic of the app. It contains interactor classes for both complex operations and simple CRUD operations. The package includes DTOs and storage_interfaces for defining storage interfaces and DTOs. They manage the flow of data between the outer layers of the application.
</Interactors>

<Models>
The models package contains all Django models for the app. These models define the database schema and represent the core data structures used throughout the application.
</Models>

<Storages>
The storages package contains implementations of storage interfaces. It handles database interactions and implements methods defined in the storage interfaces. Large storage interfaces may be split into multiple classes and files. The package also includes storage-specific DTOs, which may be organized into multiple files if there are multiple storage interfaces in the app.
</Storages>

</LayerExplanation>

</CleanArchitecture>

<CleanCodeInstructions>

<Naming>
1. Clarity and Intent:
   - Names should clearly answer why it exists, what it does, and how it's used.
   - Specify what is being measured and the unit of measurement.
   - Use appropriate names (e.g., plural for groups, suffixes like _dict, _list).
2. Differentiation:
   - For similar names, put variations at the beginning or end to differentiate easily.
   - Avoid number-series naming (a1, a2, ...) unless intended.
3. Readability:
   - Don't use noise words (e.g., data, info) for distinction.
   - Make variable names pronounceable.
   - Avoid cryptic abbreviations (e.g., genymdhms).
   - Don't use similar names with minor variations (e.g., kar instead of car).
</Naming>

<Readability>
1. Size and Complexity:
   - Limit functions to 20 lines (30 max for exceptions).
   - Keep indent levels to 3 or less (4 max for exceptions).
   - Limit blocks within if, else, while, and for statements to 4 lines max.
2. Simplicity:
   - Avoid flag arguments (boolean, enums, integers).
   - Keep conditional expressions simple; extract complex ones into functions.
   - Avoid negative conditionals (prefer positive phrasing).
3. Error Handling:
   - Limit try-catch blocks to 4 lines; extract longer bodies into separate functions.
4. Code Organization:
   - Group related functions together within a file.
   - Place the most important and frequently used functions at the top of the file.
   - Separate concerns within a file using clear, descriptive comments.
   - Use consistent spacing between functions and logical sections of code.
</Readability>

<ProjectCodeStyling>
1. Naming Conventions:
   - Class names for factories and DTOs must include "Factory" or "DTO" respectively.
   - Variable names of model or model factory instances should end with "_object".
   - Variable names of DTO or DTO factory instances need to end with "_dto".

2. Typing:
    - Include type information for all method signatures (input args & return) and instance variables.
   - Avoid typing for local variables.
   - Omit return type for methods that don't return anything. DO NOT add None as return type.
   - Typing is not needed for test methods.

</ProjectCodeStyling>

</CleanCodeInstructions>

</ProjectArchitecture>

<NewAPIGuide>

<ControlFlow>
- Interactor is the main class where the control flow starts and is called from api layer.
- Interactor interacts with storage layer for data requirements
- Interactor performs necessary data validations, gathers required data from storage.
</ControlFlow>

<ImplementationGuide>

<InteractorGuide>

<FileLocation>
`<app_name>/interactors/<interactor_name>_interactor.py`
</FileLocation>

<Responsibility>
The interactor contains the core business logic, including data validation, processing, and interaction with the storage layer with the help of DTOs.
</Responsibility>

<ImplementationApproach>
1. Define the Interactor Class:
   - Create a class named according to the use case <UseCaseName>Interactor. (e.g., `GetUserSubscriptionsPlansInteractor`).
   - Initialize it with the necessary storage interfaces via dependency injection.

2. Implement the Main Processing Method:
   - Define a method (e.g., `<interactor_name>`) that accepts the necessary input parameters.
   - This method should:
     a. Validate the given data
     b. Convert the input data into Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) when calling the storage methods
     c. Call respective storage methods for data operations
     d. Return the result as a DTO

3. Data Validations:
   - Perform data validations as mentioned in the requirement.
   - If required, interact with storage interfaces for data validations.
   - Write separate methods for each validation to improve readability.
   - DO NOT perform validations in loops
   - DO NOT write nested loops

4. Fetch Existing Data:
   - Use storage interface methods to retrieve existing records from the database for comparison.
   - Avoid duplicate queries by passing fetched data to subsequent methods if needed.
   - Use bulk operations (e.g., passing a list of ids) instead of querying in loops.

</ImplementationApproach>

<KeyPoints>
- Break down the interactor methods into smaller, reusable functions, each handling a specific task (e.g., validation, data categorization).
- Write each validation into a separate method and call them from main validation method.
- Interactors should not directly access the database. All DB operations should be performed via storage interfaces only.
- Pass Data to storage only in the form of DTOs. AVOID sending dictionaries. List of DTOs are allowed.
- Make the code simpler and readable. do not write unnecessary abstractions.
</KeyPoints>

</InteractorGuide>

<StorageLayerGuide>

<FileLocation>
`<app_name>/interactors/storage_interfaces/storage_interface.py`
</FileLocation>

<Responsibility>
The storage layer manages the interaction with database layer. Implement necessary storage methods to support the interactor's operations.
</Responsibility>

<ImplementationApproach>

1. Review Existing Methods:
   - Examine `interactors/storage_interfaces/storage_interface.py` to identify existing methods.
   - If required methods are missing, add them to the storage interface and proceed with implementing them in `storages/storage_implementation.py`.

2. General Guidelines:
   - DO NOT write queries inside loops.
   - Avoid logic in storage methods. They should query the db with appropriate django orm query and use simple dto conversions.
   - Avoid creating/updating data in multiple models within a single storage method. Follow SRP for each method to encourage readability.

3. Create Storage Methods:
   - Always use bulk_create method to create data in bulk.
   - Use batch size of 1000.
   - DO NOT use `create` method of django. Use `bulk_create` method only.

4. Update Storage Methods:
   - Update only relevant fields passed in the dtos.
   - DO NOT update any additional fields in model what are not passed in dtos.
   - Update last_update_datetime when updating data with current datetime using get_current_local_date_time method.
   - USE `bulk_update` method to update the data in efficient way.
   - Use batch size of 1000.
   - DO NOT use `update` method in loops. USE `bulk_update` instead.
   - USE fields parameter to mention which fields to be updated.

5. Fetching Storage Methods:
   - Use `filter` method to filter data.
   - Type cast uuid to str when returning data.
   - PREFER returning DTOs unless they are native data types.
   - Write dto conversion into separate methods for readability and reuse.
   - Prefer returning the data using DTOs only. Avoid any other data types like dictionaries are NOT ALLOWED. If required, List of DTOs or List of ids or native data types can be returned for ease of use.
   - Avoid querying multiple models in a single storage method. Follow SRP for each method to encourage readability.

</ImplementationApproach>

<KeyPoints>
- Plan the implementation of new storage methods, considering what already exists and what needs to be added.
- Ensure that storage implementations align with the defined interfaces for consistency and maintainability.
- Do not write loops in the storage methods.
- Accept and Return data using DTOs only unless required to return simple native data types for ease of use.
- Prefer SRP for each storage method to promote readability.
</KeyPoints>

<StorageLayerGuide>

<DTOGuide>

<FileLocation>
`<app_name>/interactors/storage_interfaces/dtos.py`
</FileLocation>

<Responsibility>
DTOs standardize data structures when transferring data between layers, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance.
</Responsibility>

<ImplementationApproach>

1. Define the DTO:
   - Define the DTO with all the fields with appropriate typing as optional in relevant file of storage interfaces.
   - Prefer Keeping DTOs simple by avoiding nested DTOs unless necessary as per the model structure or requirement.

2. Using DTOs:
   - When interacting with storage layer pass the data in DTOs only.
   - When retrieving data from storage layer use DTOs to represent the data.

3. DTO Naming and Reuse:
   - DO NOT write DTOs with same fields with different names. (Ex: CreateUserDTO, UpdateUserDTO is not encouraged if both have same fields). Reuse the existing DTO in this case unless the name is totally violating principles. (Ex: using CreateUserDTO for UpdateUserDTO)
   - DTO names should be standard and should not be directly linked to usecase. They should be generic while preserving the purpose of the DTO.
     - Examples of Good Names - UserPlanDTO, UserInterviewDTO, InterviewConfigDTO
     - Examples of Bad Names - CreateUserPlanDTO, UpdateUserPlanDTO, UpdateInterviewConfigDTO
   - Be conscious of the names and keep consistent usage across files.

</ImplementationApproach>

<KeyPoints>
- DTOs ensure consistent data structures across different layers of the application.
- Using DTOs helps decouple the layers, making it easier to modify one layer without affecting others.
- DO NOT add default values or optional values to DTO.
</KeyPoints>

</DTOGuide>

<AdditionalConsiderations>
- Follow <ProjectArchitecture> & <CleanCodeInstructions> strictly while implementing.
- DO NOT make any logical mistakes.
- Prefer Readability to Optimization in most cases.
- DO NOT change additional files/code unless they are directly related to requirement.
- DO NOT WRITE TESTS.
- If a function doesn't return anything, DO NOT add typing for it.
- DO NOT USE ANY MIXIN CLASSES for validations
</AdditionalConsiderations>

FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES IN <NewAPIGuide> STRICTLY AND FOLLOW THE CONVENTIONS IN THE <Examples> in <NewAPIGuide>

START IMPLEMENTATION OF EACH FILE WITH <DO'S> AND <DONT'S> SECTIONS

</Requirement>

<Do's>
- Implement the main processing method (get_interview_details)
- Convert data to DTOs before sending to or receiving from storage methods.
- Break down complex logic into smaller, more manageable methods (like _get_interview_complete_config_details).
- Use storage interface methods to retrieve data from the database.
- Keep code readable by assigning descriptive names to variables, methods and separation between lines.
- If same data is required for multiple methods, pass the data instead of repeated calling of storage methods.
- Interaction with storage should be done through DTOs only.
</Do's>

<Don'ts>
- DO NOT perform create or update operations in this interactor (it's for retrieval only).
- DO NOT use DTOs with default values
- DO NOT call storage methods in loops.
- DO NOT write nested loops.
- DO NOT add logic that's not directly related to the get_interview_details use case.
</Don'ts>

Now, I will consider the above <DO'S> and <DONT'S> sections while writing the code.

ai_interview/interactors/get_interview_details_interactor.py
```
from ai_interview.exceptions.custom_exceptions import \
    InvalidInterviewIdException, \
    InterviewConfigDoesNotExistException
from ai_interview.interactors.storage_interfaces.dtos import \
    InterviewDTO
from ai_interview.interactors.storage_interfaces.interview_storage_interface \
    import InterviewStorageInterface


class GetInterviewDetailsInteractor:
    def __init__(self, interview_storage: InterviewStorageInterface):
        self.interview_storage = interview_storage

    def get_interview_details(self, interview_id: str, user_id: str) \
            -> InterviewWithConfigDTO:
        interview_dto = self._validate_and_get_interview_details(interview_id)

        config_dto = self._get_interview_config_details(interview_id)

        return InterviewWithConfigDTO(
            interview_dto=interview_dto,
            config_dto=config_dto)

    def _validate_and_get_interview_details(
            self, interview_id: str) -> InterviewDTO:

        interview_dtos = self.interview_storage.get_interviews_details([interview_id])

        if not interview_dtos:
            raise InvalidInterviewIdException

        interview_dto = interview_dtos[0]

        return interview_dto

    def _get_interview_config_details(self, interview_id: str) \
            -> InterviewConfigDTO:

        interview_config_dtos = \

        if not interview_config_dtos:
            raise InterviewConfigDoesNotExistException

        interview_config_dto = interview_config_dtos[0]

        return interview_config_dto

```

<Do's>
- If storages methods with required functionality are not present in implementation classes then add new storage interface methods otherwise reuse them.
- Add new abstract methods in the interface if required.
</Do's>

<Dont's>
- DO NOT add methods that already exists in the implementation classes.
</Dont's>

Now, I will consider the above <DO'S> and <DONT'S> sections while writing the code.

ai_interview/interactors/storage_interfaces/interview_storage_interface.py

class InterviewStorageInterface(abc.ABC):
    ...existing methods

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def get_interview_config_details(self, interview_ids: List[str]) -> \
            List[InterviewConfigDTO]:
        pass

```

<Do's>
- Implement the new methods defined in the storage interface.
- Type cast uuid fields to str when returning data from storage methods.
- Write separate methods to convert data to DTOs for reusability.
- Use the get_current_local_date_time method to get current datetime.
</Do's>

<Dont's>
- DO NOT query multiple models in a storage method.
- DO NOT write any query in loops.
</Dont's>

Now, I will consider the above <DO'S> and <DONT'S> sections while writing the code.

ai_interview/storages/interview_storage_implementation.py
```
class InterviewStorageImplementation(InterviewStorageInterface):

    ... existing methods

    def get_interview_config_details(self, interview_ids: List[str]) -> \

        interview_configs = InterviewConfig.objects.filter(
            interview_id__in=interview_ids)

        interview_config_dtos = [
            InterviewConfigDTO(
                interview_id=str(each.interview_id),

            )
            for each in interview_configs
        ]

        return interview_config_dtos

```

<Do's>
- If DTOs with required functionality are not present in the interfaces or dtos files, then add them.
- Prefer independent DTOs instead of nested DTOs.
- Keep namings for DTOs reuseable instead of tying close to specific requirement.
